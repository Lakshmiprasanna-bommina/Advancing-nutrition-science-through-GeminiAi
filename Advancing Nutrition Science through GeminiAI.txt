Introduction
Nutrition science is evolving rapidly in response  to growing global health challenges, including metabolic disorders, micronutrient deficiencies, aging populations, and lifestyle-related diseases. As research expands and data becomes increasingly complex, the need for accurate, scalable, and intelligent documentation systems has never been greater. Traditional methods of recording dietary intake, clinical observations, and research findings often struggle to keep pace with the volume and variability of modern health data.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force in this landscape. By integrating machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics into nutrition documentation, AI enables more precise data capture, real-time analysis, and personalized insights. These technologies enhance the quality, consistency, and usability of nutritional records across clinical practice, research, and public health initiatives.
